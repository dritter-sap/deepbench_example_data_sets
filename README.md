# Benchmarking JSON Document Stores in Practice

This repository contains an excerpt of generated data from the DeepBench - a benchmark for document stores - as well as queries used in the paper for experiments:

- Analytical Workloads â€“ BI Benchmark (we refer to https://github.com/cwida/public_bi_benchmark, not in this repository)
- Querying Nested JSON Objects: [query, data, config](https://github.com/dritter-sap/deepbench_example_data_sets/tree/main/experiments/nested_json_object)
- Case Study: Improving Queries on Nested JSON Arrays: [query, data, config](https://github.com/dritter-sap/deepbench_example_data_sets/tree/main/experiments/unnest_json_arrays)
