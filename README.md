# Benchmarking JSON Document Stores in Practice

This repository contains an excerpt of the data and queries generated for our recent study on JSON document stores, for which we used [DeepBench](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531348.3532176) - a benchmark for document stores:

- Analytical Workloads â€“ BI Benchmark (we refer to https://github.com/cwida/public_bi_benchmark, not in this repository)
- Querying Nested JSON Objects: [query, data, config](https://github.com/dritter-sap/deepbench_example_data_sets/tree/main/experiments/nested_json_object)
- Case Study: Improving Queries on Nested JSON Arrays: [query, data, config](https://github.com/dritter-sap/deepbench_example_data_sets/tree/main/experiments/unnest_json_arrays)

> Code repository for the data and query generator part can be found in: https://github.com/SAP/json-data-and-query-generator
